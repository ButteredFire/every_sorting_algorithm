# Description
This is a program that visualizes the sorting process of 11 different algorithms:
+ Bubble Sort
+ Selection Sort
+ Insertion Sort
+ Merge Sort
+ Quick Sort
+ Heap Sort
+ Radix Sort
+ Counting Sort
+ Bucket Sort
+ Shell Sort
+ Bogo Sort


# Purpose
This project tackles one of the most common categories of algorithms, yet one that may seem overwhelming to the uninitiated. It provides an intuitive approach towards understanding how each sorting algorithm works under the hood by visualizing it and enabling interaction.

# Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Implement all algorithms in C++.
- [ ] Phase 2: Run test cases (a lot)
- [ ] Phase 3: Build UI
- [ ] Phase 4: ???
